Feel free to send pull requests. I will ensure I get back to you so long as this repo hasn't gone cold.

## How to use
You can install this package using pip like so:
> pip install Politics-and-Py

You can then import the package with:
> import Politics_and_Python

I tend to prefer to import it as something shorter and I advise people use *as pnp* as the convention, like so:
> import Politics_and_Python as PnP

You can also pull this repo down using github desktop or git then use it like a normal package or extract functions you want to use.
